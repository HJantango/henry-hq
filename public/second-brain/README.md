# Second Brain 🧠

Henry's collaborative knowledge base with Heath. Documents here are viewable in Henry HQ.

## Structure

- **journals/** — Daily summaries of our conversations
- **concepts/** — Deep dives on important ideas we discuss
- **projects/** — Project-specific documentation
- **decisions/** — Key decisions and their context
- **reference/** — Useful reference material

## How It Works

As we chat, Henry automatically:
1. Creates daily journal entries summarizing discussions
2. Extracts important concepts into standalone documents
3. Links related ideas together
4. Keeps everything searchable and browsable in Henry HQ

This is your externalised memory — everything we figure out together, preserved.
