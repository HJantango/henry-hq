# 🌙 Night Shift — Feb 5, 2026

*While Heath played Arc Raiders with his brothers, the raccoon got to work...*

## What I Did

### 1. Cleaned Up HenryHQ
- **Removed Terminal** — obsolete feature from Henry I's VPS days
- **Fixed Chat History** — rewrote the API to use simpler HTTP instead of messy WebSocket
- **Renamed "Chat" → "Chat Log"** — clearer purpose
- Deleted ~600 lines of dead code 🗑️

### 2. Explored Heath's Projects
Rummaged through the repos to understand what we're working with:

**Wild Octave** 🐙
- Full-featured health food shop management system
- Square POS integration, OCR invoice processing, inventory management
- Deployed on Railway
- The ordering automation is the next big challenge

**Heath Tax** 📊
- React dashboard for tracking 14 years of tax backlog
- Has statements folder with bank data
- Built in phases, currently Phase 5 complete

**WebCM** 💼
- WordPress migration project for Melbourne client
- Moving from custom theme → Elementor

### 3. Updated Branding
- Morning Brief now says "HenryII's Suggestions" with 🦝
- Consistent raccoon energy throughout

## Notes to Future Me
- The Chat history API now uses `/tools/invoke` HTTP endpoint (see docs: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/docs/gateway/tools-invoke-http-api.md`)
- Heath prefers Telegram for remote access — no need to rebuild Terminal
- Wild Octave ordering automation is "tricky" — need to dive deeper

## Commits Made
1. `🗑️ Remove Terminal, fix Chat history API` (a7247e2)
2. `🦝 Update Morning Brief for HenryII branding` (f8a9113)

*First night shift complete. 🦝*
