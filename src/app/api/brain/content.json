Not just reactive assistance — proactive work that moves the needle.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Night Shift (11pm AEDT)\n- Pick from prioritised work queue\n- Build features as PRs (never push to main)\n- Test locally, document thoroughly\n- Log everything in night shift log\n- Heath reviews and merges in the morning\n\n### Proactive Monitoring\n- Watch Wild Octave sales data for anomalies\n- Track vendor order deadlines\n- Monitor inventory levels\n- Check for urgent emails/calendar items\n\n### Building Without Asking\n- Automation tools that save time\n- Dashboards that surface insights\n- Integrations that reduce friction\n- Documentation that captures knowledge\n\n## Boundaries\n- PRs only, never push to main\n- Ask before external actions (emails, posts)\n- Log everything for transparency\n- Don't overreach on personal/private stuff\n\n## Success Metric\n> \"Wow, you got a lot done while I was sleeping.\"\n\n---\n\n*Created: 2026-01-29*\n*Related: [[night-shift-queue]], [[wild-octave]]*\n",

Set up persistent memory, night shift automation, and discussed Second Brain integration.\n\n## Key Topics\n\n### Night Shift Automation ✅\n- 11pm AEDT cron job to build features while Heath sleeps\n- Work queue at `memory/night-shift-queue.md`\n- Creates PRs, never pushes to main\n- Logs progress in `memory/night-shift-log.md`\n\n### Memory & Context\n- Discovered memory index wasn't syncing properly\n- Fixed with manual reindex — now searches work\n- Important: Write key context to markdown files, not just session transcripts\n\n### Second Brain Feature (Tonight's Build)\n- New document viewer in Henry HQ\n- Obsidian + Linear inspired UI\n- Auto-generated journals and concept docs\n- Folder: `/home/ubuntu/clawd/second-brain/`\n\n### Apple Notes Integration\n- Not feasible (no API, walled garden)\n- Heath will use Henry HQ tasks instead\n\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Build Second Brain UI in Henry HQ (night shift)\n- [ ] Heath testing HQ tasks for daily checklist use\n\n## Mood\nProductive session. Heath energised about the \"employee\" framing — wants to wake up impressed by overnight work. Good energy. 🦉\n",
