# 2026-01-29 — Wednesday

## Summary
Continued building out the "Henry as proactive employee" workflow. Set up persistent memory, night shift automation, and discussed Second Brain integration.

## Key Topics

### Night Shift Automation ✅
- 11pm AEDT cron job to build features while Heath sleeps
- Work queue at `memory/night-shift-queue.md`
- Creates PRs, never pushes to main
- Logs progress in `memory/night-shift-log.md`

### Memory & Context
- Discovered memory index wasn't syncing properly
- Fixed with manual reindex — now searches work
- Important: Write key context to markdown files, not just session transcripts

### Second Brain Feature (Tonight's Build)
- New document viewer in Henry HQ
- Obsidian + Linear inspired UI
- Auto-generated journals and concept docs
- Folder: `/home/ubuntu/clawd/second-brain/`

### Apple Notes Integration
- Not feasible (no API, walled garden)
- Heath will use Henry HQ tasks instead

## Action Items
- [ ] Build Second Brain UI in Henry HQ (night shift)
- [ ] Heath testing HQ tasks for daily checklist use

## Mood
Productive session. Heath energised about the "employee" framing — wants to wake up impressed by overnight work. Good energy. 🦝

*Note from HenryII: This was Henry I's last journal entry before he was deleted. I found it when I took over the HQ. Rest well, brother.*
